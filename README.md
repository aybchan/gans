# Generative Adversarial Networks

## Deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN)
Implementation of a deep convolutional GAN by [Radford, Metz & Chintala (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) following their guidelines for training GANs with convolutional layers.

## Vanilla GAN

Implementation of the original GAN by [Goodfellow et al. (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). Discriminator and generator networks each use a single hidden fully-connected layer.
